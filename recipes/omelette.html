    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul class="Ingredients">
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Diced Onion</li>
        <li>Salted Butter</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To start, begin by preparing the filling. To do so, cook the bacon, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the bacon is cooked and the onion is soft. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs until they are homogenous.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in an 8" nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Add the whisked eggs and swirl them until they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set.</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to slightly push in the edges and swirl the pan so any uncooked eggs move to the edges to cook.</li>
        <li>Once the omelette is mostly set, carefully flip it and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cheese on top and add the filling on one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the omelette and serve either with garnish or by itself.</li>
    </ol>
